## Philosophy

Dhriti is more than a habit tracker — it's a gentle reminder to stay steady in a fast-paced world.  
It draws from the resilience of the lotus: grounded, graceful, and blooming even in the murkiest waters.

> _“Even in the shadows, a lotus blooms,  
> Unseen but unbroken, shining true.”_


A reminder that growth doesn't always need to shout.


## Future Features

* **Emotion-Based Habit Suggestions:** Imagine sharing how you’re feeling in your own words, and the app picks up on your mood—whether it’s fatigue, stress, or low energy. Using sentiment analysis, it will suggest tailored habits like gentle exercises, mindfulness practices, or better sleep routines to help you bounce back and stay on track with your goals.
